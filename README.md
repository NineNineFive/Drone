# Drone Project

This project was made as part of my studies at Roskilde University
It is no longer maintained
The programming was made for controlling Tello Drones with an Arduino controller
The script can be installed on an Arduino and it will open a wifi router. The Tello Drone can then connect to the wifi router.


This project was developed together with @ahraza51214 https://github.com/ahraza51214
